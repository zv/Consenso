Consenso
========

Consenso is a project to interrupt the continuum of everyday processor architecture and all the normal expectations that go with it.


# What exists?

At this point myself and @jessyexum have implemented a desired basic instruction set architecture emulator and have a workable target definition for LLVM, which is an almost direct port of the SPARC architecture.
